## Application Idea
---
I run a weekly Dungeons and Dragons campaign for my family.  We a scattered across the country so I use Roll20 to host
the game.  Everyone is constantly having to look up items in their inventory, and the system provided does not give much
information on the items to the player.  That is where this Advanced DND Inventory Assistance tool will come into play.

The tool will allow each player to keep track of their inventory in real time, providing more detail than the system 
currently available to them.  It will include both pre-populated data for already available items and the ability to 
add homebrew style items to the inventory.  

My inspiration is the current inventory system available with [roll20.net](http://www.roll20.net), and what I consider
to be improvements on it.
