## Application Idea
---
I run a weekly Dungeons and Dragons campaign for my family.  We a scattered across the country so I use Roll20 to host
the game.  Everyone is constantly having to look up items in their inventory, and the system provided does not give much
information on the items to the player.  That is where this Advanced DND Inventory Assistance tool will come into play.

---
## Functionality
- A clickable inventory for the specific player
- The inventory will include:
-- The name of the item
-- A description of the item
-- A picture of the item 
-- How many of the item the player is carrying
-- An area for the player to makes notes about the item.
